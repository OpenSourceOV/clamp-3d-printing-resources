# Clamp 3D Printing Resources

All the 3D printable files to create the OpenSourceOV clamp for time-lapse capture of images and leaves are available in the 3d-printing-files folder. The easiest way to get hold of these files is to [https://github.com/OpenSourceOV/clamp-3d-printing-resources/archive/master.zip](download the repository zip file). Unzip and the files will be in the 3d-printing-files folder.

## Printing the files

The .prn files in the 3d-printing-files folder can be opened by any 3D printing software and can be printed by any 3D printer. However there is a diverse range in 3D printers, from cheaper hobbyist models to super expensive large-scale industrial printers. As you'd expect there is a broad range in printing quality and a growing number of materials that can be printed.

Although the price of 3D printers has dropped significantly in recent years an outlay of several thousand dollars is still required for a 3D printer that can print durable parts (within reason!) with sufficient accuracy. Fortunately there is a growing service industry for printing parts online and there are a number of online 3d printers capable of quickly and affordably printing good quality parts.

## Alternatives

Most universities will have a 3D printer... somewhere. Especially in the engineering and art & design departments. Time to make friends with the technicians.

## Modifying the 3D models

Great! OpenSourceOV is an open source project that wants the community to tweak, improve, experiment and help build the next generation of the clamp. TinkerCAD ([https://www.tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com)) is an excellent and free online 3D editor. Create a free TinkerCAD account then import the clamp model publicly available at [https://tinkercad.com/things/7c08LzE3G9j](https://tinkercad.com/things/7c08LzE3G9j). Click 'Sign up to copy', sign up then copy to your own TinkerCAD workspace to edit. If you haven't used TinkerCAD before then you can quickly work your way through their excellent [online tutorials](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/).
