# Clamp 3D Printing Resources

All the 3D printable files to create the OpenSourceOV clamps are available in the following folders. The easiest way to get hold of these files is to [download the entire repository zip](https://github.com/OpenSourceOV/clamp-3d-printing-resources/archive/master.zip). Unzip and the files will be in the relevant folder.

* **Clamp Version 1** files available in [/clamp-version-1](./clamp-version-1)

* **Clamp Version 2** (the preferred version) files are available in [/clamp-version-2](./clamp-version-2)

## Printing the files

The .prn / .stl files can be opened by any 3D printing software and can be printed by any 3D printer. 

There is now a diverse range in 3D printers, from cheaper hobbyist models to super-expensive large-scale industrial printers. As you'd expect the result is a broad range in print quality and a growing number of options for materials that can be printed. Although the various recesses and holes for the clamp nuts and bolts have been given extra room than required to accommodate to some degree the varying accuracy and quality of 3D prints, many of the cheaper 3D printers are simply not going to provide the accuracy or durability required. 

Fortunately there is a growing service industry for printing accurate and durable parts online and there are a number of online 3D printers capable of quickly and affordably printing good quality parts. See below for more information.

Before printing an entire batch it's worth sending just one of the parts for printing to test the quality and accuracy.

## List of online 3D printing services

A list of 3D printing suppliers can be found in the  [https://github.com/OpenSourceOV/resources](https://github.com/OpenSourceOV/resources) repository.

## Alternatives

Most universities will have a 3D printer... somewhere. Especially in the engineering and art & design departments.

## Modifying the 3D models

Great! OpenSourceOV is an open source project that wants the community to tweak, improve, experiment and help build the next generation of clamps. See [Contributing](http://www.opensourceov.org/contributing/) on OpenSourceOV.org for more information.
